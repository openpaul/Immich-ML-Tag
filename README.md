# Immich ML Tags

This repo is a immich plugin, which uses the smart-search CLIP embeddings to try to predict your tags.

**Early development**

This repo is very early development stage. I hope I get this working well soon but as of now I will have to refactor it a lot before it can be used.

## Requirements

You need to have your postgress docker port exposed

## AI use disclaimer
Claude Opus 4.5 was used to generate at least some parts of the codebase.
